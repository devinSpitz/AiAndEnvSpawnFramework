-- Deprecated --  AiAndEnvSpawnFramework
=======
Had to deprecate the package cause of breaking changes like renaming (Arma naming convention) and making it more consistent with how it works. Sorry for that.

The new package can be found here and has also the ability to scale with player counts etc.
https://github.com/devinSpitz/NightOps-DynamicSpawnFramework



 - It does spawn and despawns on player contact just with hierarchy no naming
 - It does add the waypoint automatically to the ai without naming them as in the example shown and only how in the example shown :D
 - It does recreate the navmesh for all created env if wanted
 - It does only spawn a percentage amount of the ai randomized if wanted
 - It does respawn Ai after dying if wanted
 - It does spawn Vehicles and Enviroment
 - It can be called outside of the trigger function by script by simple calling Spawn() or Despawn()
 - It does support 4 types of Waypoints: Patrol, Cycle, GetInNearest, Defend
